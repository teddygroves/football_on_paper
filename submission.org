***  Rationale for chosen topic
The book /Basketball on paper/ introduces some helpful concepts for
statistically analysing basketball on a possession-by-possession basis. My talk
will explore how these concepts can be applied to soccer, helping FC
Nordsjælland to break down deep blocks.

The main idea I will borrow is to evaluate teams and players based on the
scores they tend to achive or allow per sequence of play.

***  Your approach to answering this question
The first step in my analysis is to identify sequences of play where the
defending team employs a low block. I have found a simple rule for doing this
based on event data - if there are 7 passes in a single sequence, I assume that
the defending team has had time to position their players behind the ball. This
approach is not perfect but I think it is a reasonable first approximation. I
will explore ways to use it to identify deep block sequences more accurately.

In order to score sequences, I will use all available data to try to capture
the total danger that the attacking team created. A simple way of doing this is
to score each sequence according to the highest expected goals value of all its
passes and shots.

To shed light on how best to break down a deep block, I'll make a predictive
model of the deep block sequences' scores. Looking at where this model's
predictions tend to fail will help to answer questions like

- Do FCN's deep block sequences crucially depend on any particular players?
- Do FCN tend to do better than expected against deep blocks towards the start
  or end of the game?
- Do FCN's deep block sequences go better or worse than expected depending on
  how far the sequence starts further away from the opponent's goal?

*** The applications of this research within a professional football environment
To illustrate this general approach I applied my planned analysis to the
provided data. I identified 1463 deep block sequences using the criteria
outlined above and found expected goals for passes and shots using the opta
qualifiers 318 and 321. In order to best highlight outlying sequences I fit a
simple mulitlevel model that predicted best expected goals, taking into account
the attacking team, the defending team, home advantage, starting distance from
the goal and time.

Here is a plot of the model's predictions vs what actually happened. The x axis
shows the distance from the goal at the start of the sequence and the y axis
shows the sequence's maximum expected goals on logit scale. The model's
predictions for each sequence are represented by a grey bar.

From this plot it is clear that some teams had a lot more deep block sequences
than others. For example, Manchester City had 148 deep block sequences whereas
Newcastle United had only 23 (the two teams had 573 and 603 total sequences
respectively).

Of the teams with lots of deep block sequences, the model predicted those of
Tottenham Hotspur well, with few outliers and only 18% of sequences falling
outside their 10%-90% credible intervals. On the other hand, 24% of Arsenal's
sequences lie outside the credible intervals and the gaps tend to be
larger. This pattern suggested to me that it might be worth looking closer at
Arsenal's sequences to find what the model is missing.

To find if Arsenal's deep block sequences depend on any particular players, I
looked at the order in which players were involved in their five deep block
sequences with the highest and lowest maximum expected goals. The thing that
stuck out tom me was that Özil's name appears many times in the first list but
only once in the second.

Arsenal's 5 deep block sequences with highest expected goals:

Comparing Özil's sequences to those of Xhaka gives an interesting insight into
Arsenal's deep block strategy. Özil was involved in all but two of Arsenal's
outlying sequences on the good side and only two on the bad side. In most of
the bad cases, Xhaka was involved but Özil was not. Perhaps Arsenal could have
improved their deep block strategy by making it easier for Özil to get the ball.

A similar approach can be used to identify problems in a team's deep block
strategy. For example, West Ham United's deep block sequences tended to go
worse when their goalkeeper Hart was involved, suggesting to a possible issue
with how they were playing the ball out from the goalkeeper. In contrast, Manchester
City tended to be roughly as effective when their goalkeeper Ederson was
involved as they were in other sequences:
