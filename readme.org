* How to reproduce my analysis
First, make sure you have installed all the dependencies and have suitable xml
files in the ~example_data~ folder.

To munge the xml data into a nice analyseable form, run the python scripts
~write_events.py~ and ~write_sequences.py~ as follows:

#+begin_src bash
python write_events.py
python write_sequences.py
#+end_src

To perform the analysis, run the python script ~run_analysis.py~:

#+begin_src bash
python run_analysis
#+end_src
 
This should create some plots in the ~plots~ folder.
